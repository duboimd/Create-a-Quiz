#Create your own quiz with five questions.                                     You can ask questions that require:
#A number as an answer (e.g., What is 1+1?)
#Text (e.g. What is Harry Potter's last name?)
#True or False
#A selection (Which of these choices are correct? A, B, or C?)
#If the user answers a question correctly, print Correct. Else, print Incorrect and move on to the next question.
#At the end of the program print how many questions they answered correctly.
